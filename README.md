Fuel Economy of Cars
==================
This application explores the mpg dataset from the ggplot2 package. The dataset consists of fuel economy data from 1999 to 2008 for 38 popular car models. Cars which have a new release every year between 1999 and 2008 was used as a proxy for the popularity of the car.
  
The dataset consists of 234 observations with 11 variables.
+ manufacturer
+ model
+ displ: engine displacement, in litres
+ year
+ cyl: number of cylinders
+ trans: type of transmission
+ drv: f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
+ cty: city miles per gallon
+ hwy: highway miles per gallon
+ fl: fuel
    - e: ethanol E85
    - d: diesel
    - r: regular
    - p: premium
    - c: CNG (note as far as I know the civic is basically the only passenger car that runs on CNG in the US).
